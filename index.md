    <p>
      Welcome! I am a PhD student specializing how models adapt under distribution shift, 
      addressing challenges including catastrophic forgetting, continual learning, and few-shot generalization. 
      My advisor is <a href="https://www.fit.edu/faculty-profiles/b/bhattacharyya-siddhartha/" target="_blank">Siddhartha Bhattacharyya</a>, 
      and I am funded by NASA, where I am working on lane detection for autonomous driving and taxiing on airports. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at BITS Pilani Dubai, 
      where I finished my thesis under the guidance of 
      <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/dubai/raja-muthalagu/" target="_blank">Raja Muthalaghu</a> and received the 
      Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award. 
      Alongside my PhD, I have worked closely with mentors from Microsoft Research, NASA Langley, UTHealth Houston, Collins Aerospace. 
      Through these collaborations, I have gained extensive experience in self-supervised models, diffusion models, and multimodal large-language models.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>I’m open to collaborations—feel free to reach out if our interests align.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Also, I’m actively seeking a research internship for Summer 2026—ideally one where the loss goes down, and my learning goes up!!</strong>
