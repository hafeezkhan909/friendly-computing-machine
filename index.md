    <p>Welcome! I work at the intersection of <strong>generative AI</strong>, <strong>distribution shift</strong>, and <strong>medical AI</strong>. My recent projects include test-time prompt refinement for text-to-image models, modular adaptation for lane detection under domain shift, and 3D cardiac flow reconstruction.</p>
    <p>Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at BITS Pilani Dubai and collaborate closely with mentors at Microsoft, NASA, and UTHealth Houston. I'm open to collaborations—feel free to reach out by email.</p>
